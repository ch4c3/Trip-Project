Dec 17th - Dec 21th

-We decided to switch from Hilton to the Belmond Copacabana Palace, since it is our graduation trip 
and we have a substantial budget

-Stay is $343 per night per person (5 people), therefore $1715.00 per night as a group. 

-We are staying there 3 days and two nights so the total for the whole group will come out to $3430.00 
because we would be checking out on the third day

-This hotel is right on the beach and has alot of popular bars right on the private hotel beach. 

-There are multiple restaurants to choose from and each one is special in its own way.
